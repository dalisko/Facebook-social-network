# Shortest paths on facebook data

- This is a project done as part of the Networks and Markets course taught during the fall of 2019 as Cornell Tech by Dr. Rafael Pass.

- It contains my own implementation of a shortest path algorithm for graphs & its application on the Facebook social network data available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html.
